oc3-frontend is a single-page application that replaces the web2py + jQuery interface of
the legacy collector ([opensvc/collector](https://github.com/opensvc/collector)). It talks
exclusively to the oc3 REST API, typed from its OpenAPI specification, and receives
changes in real time over the websocket of the oc3 messenger.

## Features

**Inventory and operations**

- About thirty views: nodes, clusters, services, instances, resources, actions,
  networks, disks, SAN switches, hardware, packages, apps, tags, requests, compliance
  (modulesets, rulesets, designer, logs), statistics, and administration (users, teams,
  filters, filtersets, forms, metrics, charts, reports).
- Tabbed detail panels (properties, inventory, checks, alerts, logs, sysreport,
  statistics…), with a history of the records viewed, bookmarks and cross-links between
  objects.
- Actions on objects from a dedicated menu: queued agent actions (start, stop, freeze…)
  and data actions, filtered by the user's privileges and confirmed before they run.

**Lists**

- Per-column filters in a popover, with operators, regular expressions and the
  distribution of values; multi-column sorting; column selection and ordering.
- CSV and XLSX export of the whole selection, hidden columns included on demand.
- Comparison of the selected rows (common attributes), and saving the active filters as
  a filterset.
- Columns, sort, filters and page size remembered with the user's account.

**Navigation**

- Global search (`Ctrl+K` or `/`) across every kind of object, narrowed to one kind with
  a prefix (`node:`, `svc:`, `fset:`…), as in the legacy collector.
- Session filter: a filterset that narrows every list at once.
- Keyboard shortcuts (`?` lists them); detail panels on the right or on the left.

**Accessibility and appearance**

- English and French interface, with bilingual search.
- Light and dark modes; standard, high-contrast and colour-blind friendly themes.
- A state is never conveyed by colour alone: an icon, a shape or a label always goes with it.
- Live updates, without reloading, as the agents send their data.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 24 LTS or later (see `.nvmrc`) and npm;
- a reachable **oc3** instance: its API (`server`) and its messenger (websocket);
- a collector account to sign in with.

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/opensvc/oc3-frontend.git
cd oc3-frontend
cp .env.example .env    # oc3 API address, see Configuration
npm install
npm run dev             # http://localhost:5173
```

In development, Vite serves the application and proxies `/api` and `/realtime` to oc3:
the browser only ever talks to a single origin, so there is no CORS to configure.

After a change to the oc3 API, regenerate the client types:

```sh
npm run gen:api         # updates src/lib/api/schema.d.ts from the OpenAPI spec
```

## Configuration

Variables go in `.env` (never committed; `.env.example` is the template).

| Variable              | Purpose                                                              | Default                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `OC3_API_TARGET`      | URL of the oc3 API that `/api` is proxied to                         | `http://localhost:8080`                  |
| `OC3_OPENAPI_URL`     | URL of the OpenAPI spec read by `npm run gen:api`                    | `http://127.0.0.1:8081/api/openapi.json` |
| `OC3_REALTIME_TARGET` | URL of the oc3 messenger that `/realtime` is proxied to              | API host, port `8889`                    |
| `OC3_PUBLIC_HOST`     | Public host name when the dev server is exposed behind a TLS gateway | empty                                    |

## Scripts

| Command             | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`       | Development server with hot reload                 |

| `npm run preview`   | Serve the production build locally                 |
| `npm run typecheck` | Type check only                                    |

## Architecture

| Area        | Choice                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| UI          | React 19, strict TypeScript, Vite                                                        |
| Data        | TanStack Query, typed `openapi-fetch` client generated by `openapi-typescript`           |
| Routing     | TanStack Router; the state of each view (sort, filters, selection, tab) lives in the URL |
| Tables      | TanStack Table and Virtual                                                               |
| Styling     | Tailwind CSS 4 and design tokens (`src/styles/tokens.css`)                               |
| Translation | i18next, `en` and `fr` catalogs                                                          |

A few principles hold it together:

- every API call goes through `src/lib/api/client.ts` and TanStack Query;
  `src/lib/api/schema.d.ts` is generated and never edited by hand;
- a gap in the API is fixed in the oc3 spec, not worked around here;
- colours, radii and sizes come from the design tokens, never from hard-coded values;
- every visible string goes through `t()`, in English and in French.

## Deployment

The application and the oc3 API must share **one HTTPS origin**: the sign-in cookies are
`Secure` and `__Host-` prefixed, and oc3 refuses session requests coming from another
origin. Terminate TLS in front of the frontend, on the public host name — the one
`server.oidc.redirect_url` names when OpenID Connect sign-in is enabled.

### Container image

The `Dockerfile` builds the application and serves it with an unprivileged nginx
(uid 101, port 8080), which also proxies `/api` and `/realtime` to oc3:

```sh
docker build \
  --build-arg VERSION="$(git describe --tags --always)" \
  --build-arg BUILDTIME="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" \
  -t opensvc/oc3-frontend .

docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
  -e OC3_API_UPSTREAM=http://oc3-server:8081 \
  -e OC3_REALTIME_UPSTREAM=http://oc3-messenger:8889 \
  opensvc/oc3-frontend
```

| Variable                | Purpose                                                    | Default                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `OC3_API_UPSTREAM`      | oc3 server that `/api` is proxied to, path kept            | `http://oc3-server:8081`    |
| `OC3_REALTIME_UPSTREAM` | oc3 messenger that the `/realtime` websocket is proxied to | `http://oc3-messenger:8889` |
| `OC3_LISTEN_PORT`       | Port nginx listens on inside the container                 | `8080`                      |
| `OC3_MAX_BODY_SIZE`     | Largest request body accepted for `/api`                   | `32m`                       |

The nginx configuration lives in `deploy/nginx/`. Besides the proxying, it:

- returns `index.html` for any path that is not a file, since the application does its
  own routing;
- caches the hashed files of `assets/` for a year, and never caches `index.html`, so a new
  release is picked up at the next page load;
- sets a strict Content-Security-Policy (everything from this origin only), along with
  `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options` and `Referrer-Policy`;
- forwards `X-Forwarded-Proto` from the TLS gateway, or sets it from its own scheme;
- answers `GET /healthz`, used by the image's `HEALTHCHECK`.

nginx resolves the upstream host names when it starts: they must exist by then.

### Other web servers

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
```

`dist/` holds static files. Serve them on the same origin as above, with the same rules
as `deploy/nginx/default.conf.template`: `/api` to the oc3 API, `/realtime` (websocket) to
the oc3 messenger, `index.html` for any other unknown path.

### Single-file build

```sh
npm ci
npm run build:single
```

`dist-single/index.html` is the whole application in one file (about 2 MB, 660 kB
gzipped): the script, the stylesheet, the fonts and the images are inlined, nothing else
is loaded. Serve it on the same origin as above, for `/` and any path that is not `/api`
or `/realtime`.

The file carries its own Content-Security-Policy, in a `<meta>` tag: its single inline
script allowed by hash, fonts and images as data URIs, everything else from this origin
only. The header policy of `deploy/nginx/security-headers.conf` forbids inline scripts:
a server of the single file must not send it, nor any policy stricter than the file's.
Since nothing is cached apart, every page load downloads the whole file: prefer the
standard build where long-term caching matters.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome through pull requests. Before opening one:

```sh
npm run typecheck && npm run lint
```

- Code comments are written in English.
- Every new visible string is added to both `src/i18n/locales/en.json` and `fr.json`.
- A new npm dependency must be justified in the pull request; a copied component or a few
  lines of code are preferred.
- A view ported from the legacy collector lists its deliberate parity gaps.
